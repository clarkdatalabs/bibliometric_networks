Bibliometric Networks

Things tried:

pyvis.network -- took a long time to render, with slow manipulation. pros: only a couple lines of code to make the networkx functionally interactive

networkx -- took several minutes to render, very little options for manipulation. pros: easy to build network

igraph -- not intuitive for even building a network.
