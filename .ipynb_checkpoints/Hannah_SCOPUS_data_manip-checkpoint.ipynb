    "Networks can provide significant measures to identify data driven patterns and dependencies. Though, given a data file it can be difficult to discern how one may approach creating such a network. In this tutorial, we will use a bibliographic data file downloaded from a query search in <a href = https://www.scopus.com/search/form.uri>Scopus</a> to walk through the process of cleaning the data file, writing a python script to parse the data into nodes and edges, computing graphical measures using <a href = https://networkx.github.io/documentation/stable/index.html>NetworkX</a>, and creating an interactive network display using <a hred = http://holoviews.org/>HoloViews</a>.

    "### Notes on Data Manipulation in Excel\n",
    "\n",
    "This section is specific to SCOPUS downloaded files, as some downloadable queries are unfortunately imperfect. Firstly, some rows are skewed from inaccurate reading and parsing. Simply scroll through the file and delete any rows where the data is clearly mismatched (i.e. an author name in the 'Title' column, a numerical value in a non-numerical column, etc.). \n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, across several different queries, we discovered duplicates in entry 'Title,' with other columns containing conflicting data. To fix this issue for the purposes of producing a network, we want to remove duplicates. \n",
    "\n",
    "In Excel with your csv file open, select Date -> Table Tools -> Remove Duplicates. Indicate that the csv file has headers, as all SCOPUS files will, and only select the 'Title' column by which duplicates will be identified. \n",
    "\n",
    "After executing this command, it is important to save the file as a csv. Otherwise, Excel may default to a txt, or other format, and some data features may be lost. By continuously saving the file as a csv, we ensure that it will continue to be compatible with the python code for this tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "Generally, for the case of creating a connected network, we want the rows in our bibliographic data file to have an identifiable title and list of references. "
